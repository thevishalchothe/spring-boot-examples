# spring-boot-examples ‚öôÔ∏èüìä

This `spring-boot-examples` repository demonstrates Spring Boot concepts including Auto-Configuration, Starter Dependencies (Web, DevTools), Embedded Servers (Tomcat), RESTful APIs, and Logging with SLF4J.

## Project Architecture üìÇ

### hello-spring-boot Example

The `hello-spring-boot` project is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates basic Spring Boot features, including:

- **Basic Spring Boot Application Setup**: A simple `@SpringBootApplication` to get started with Spring Boot.
- **RestController**: A basic RESTful controller to handle requests and return greetings.
- **Simple Endpoints**: Demonstrates two simple endpoints:  
  - `/` ‚Üí Shows a welcome message with instructions  
  - `/hello` ‚Üí Manually add in the URL to view the personalized greeting

### spring-boot-logging Example

The `spring-boot-logging` project demonstrates logging in Spring Boot using SLF4J with the default Logback implementation:

- **Logger Integration**: Uses `Logger` and `LoggerFactory` to log messages at different levels.
- **RESTful Controller**: Exposes an endpoint `/logs/test` to trigger logs at various levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Log Message Meaning**:
  - `TRACE` ‚Üí  Detailed debug info, typically used for diagnosing specific issues during development, usually for developers.
  - `DEBUG` ‚Üí Useful for debugging, shows application state and flow.
  - `INFO` ‚Üí General app events (startup, shutdown, or configuration updates.
  - `WARN` ‚Üí Something unexpected happened, but the application is still running fine.
  - `ERROR` ‚Üí Serious issues that may affect functionality.
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Log output can be easily adjusted through the `application.properties` file.
```
   - # Set the logging level
    - # Only show logs of level INFO and above (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
      - logging.level.root=INFO

    - # Or to test all levels including DEBUG and TRACE:
      - #logging.level.root=TRACE

  - # Log pattern (optional)
      - #logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n
```
