# spring-boot-thymeleaf example üñ•Ô∏èüöÄ

## What is Thymeleaf? ‚ùì 

**Thymeleaf** is a modern server-side Java template engine for Java-based web and standalone applications.  
It allows you to create dynamic web pages with natural templating syntax, easily integrated into Spring Boot projects.

-  Server-side rendering of HTML views  
-  Natural templating: templates can be opened as static files in browsers without a server  
-  Supports form binding, conditional rendering, iteration, internationalization, and more  
-  Designed to work seamlessly with Spring MVC and Spring Boot

##  Why use Thymeleaf? üéØ

- **Clean and intuitive HTML templates**: Easy for frontend and backend developers to collaborate  
- **Full integration with Spring Boot**: Works out of the box with Spring MVC model attributes  
- **No JavaScript dependencies**: Server renders the complete page before sending to the client  
- **Supports form submission and validation** directly in templates  
- **Better developer experience** with natural templates that look like HTML
